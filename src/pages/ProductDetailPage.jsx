                        <p>
                          A Pocket PC is a handheld computer, which features
                          many of the same capabilities as a modern PC. These
                          handy little devices allow individuals to retrieve and
                          store e-mail messages, create a contact file,
                          coordinate appointments, surf the internet, exchange
                          text messages and more. Every product that is labeled
                          as a Pocket PC must be accompanied with specific
                          software to operate the unit and must feature a
                          touchscreen and touchpad.

                          As is the case with any new technology product, the
                          cost of a Pocket PC was substantial during itâ€™s early
                          release. For approximately $700.00, consumers could
                          purchase one of top-of-the-line Pocket PCs in 2003.
                          These days, customers are finding that prices have
                          become much more reasonable now that the newness is
                          wearing off. For approximately $350.00, a new Pocket
                          PC can now be purchased.

                        <p>
                          Polyester is deemed lower quality due to its none
                          natural qualityâ€™s. Made from synthetic materials, not
                          natural like wool. Polyester suits become creased
                          easily and are known for not being breathable.
                          Polyester suits tend to have a shine to them compared
                          to wool and cotton suits, this can make the suit look
                          cheap. The texture of velvet is luxurious and
                          breathable. Velvet is a great choice for dinner party
                          jacket and can be worn all year round.
